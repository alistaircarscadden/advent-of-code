dXXpY.py
  => day XX part Y
     input files in ./XX/
     run with: `python dXXpY.py XX/Z` (Z is usually `input` or `test`)

day 1-12 were completed not at midnight
day 13-  were completed at midnight

code is not necessarily exactly what i ran to get my answer. if i think
something i wrote could be useful for another puzzle then i factor it out
into common.py.
